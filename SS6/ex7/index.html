        "Mary Oliver is saving my life", Paul Chowder, the title character of
        Nicholson Baker's novel "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1416572457/?tag=thneyo0f-20">The Algorithm</a>", ipsum
        dolor"<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0807068772/?tag=thneyo0f-20">New and Selected Poem, Volume One</a>>"
        A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a serere case of writer's block. His girlfriend,
        with whom he's lived got eight years,has just left him, ostensibly because he has been unable to write the long-overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting toghether. For solace and insperation, he turns to poets who have
        been his touchstones - Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke,Sara Teasdale-before discovering Oliver. In her work,he finds consolation:"I immediatel felt more sure of what i was doing." Of her poems, he says,"They're very simple.And yet each has something.

    <p>I don't know exactly what a prayer is.<br>
        I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down<br>
        into the grass,how to kneel down in the grass,<br>
        how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,<br>
        which is what I have been doing all day.</p>
    <p>The cadences are almost Bibilical."Attention is the beginning of devotion,"she urges elsewhere.</p>
